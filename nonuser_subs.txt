my husband is having a thing Disclaimer; This is in no way meant to sound condescending.   So tomorrow my husband is having a do! Meaning he has invited his Playstation Battlefield squad over for a barbecue. And I am so exited.   We just came home from shopping for the event. Walking around the supermarket was so fun. He carefully chose the meat, drinks, beers whatever. The reason I'm so exited? Well, when he and I met 15 years ago he was bad company. Drugs, Hells Angels and what have you. Never held a steady job. Quite the catch. But I love him.   During these past 15 years he has made a full 180 change. Got an education. My dad gave him a job in his business in the airport.   The only thing he had a hard time with was friends. When he and I started getting serious he dumped to old friends. Simply because they were idiots and bad influences. For a very long time he didn't have any friends. Through Playstation he got to know new friends. And those friends are coming over tomorrow. It's going to be a great party.   We can't have children so I don't know what it's like. But I guess I feel the same any mother does when her kid is growing up and having his first party.   What I'm trying to say is. My man changed. Not for me. For himself. Turned his life around and came out the other side as a better person.   I love him!

we decided not to buy a bearded dragon. My wife and I were looking at getting a bearded dragon for our son for his birthday. A young beardie is only about $60. So we set aside $200 in our budget counting on buying a reptile aquarium and some incidentals.   Then we learned it needs expensive UV bulbs that last about 6 months and are about $40 each. Also the electricity cost the run this heat 24 hours can be a drain on the electric bill.   Also the beardie needs to go to the vet every 6 months for a checkup. And finally, food. They have a very diverse diet and can eat up to $15 per week in foods. So I did a total cost analysis for a beardie that lives 12 years and it turned out to be a whopping $10,000   Life pro tip, do a total cost analysis on pets before deciding to purchase. Even free pets are absurdly expensive. In 12 years both of my kids are going to be in college and I will desperately need $10,000 then. I will not need an aging lizard.  Edit: For everyone giving me shit about my poor son, don't pity him. First he didn't know about the beardie. Second we are taking that $200 and taking him to an amusement park. He's fine.   Edit 2: This post is not about "don't buy pets, they're expensive." The post is about "make sure you're aware of the full cost of something before making a decision." Yes we have kids and dogs. Yes they're more expensive than lizards, but for us well worth the cost. A reptile, not so much.   Edit 3: Thank you all for the "you're way overestimating" and the "you're way underestimating" posts. The accuracy of the cost really isn't the issue. The issue is we were expecting something minimal and almost made a big mistake. The point is, we did the research and it was way more than we were expecting and wanting to pay. To us, it wasn't worth it. We have other pets. We aren't frugal, but we are smart with our money. I am simply encouraging others to do cost analysis. And at the end of the day if a bearded dragon is worth 10k to you, awesome! Do it. 
iama private tutor to the children of the lawyers, doctors, and executives of nyc. basically, i get paid $140/hr to do science experiments with kids! **My short bio:** Hi reddit,  My last AMA on /r/entrepreneur got pretty popular, so I figured I'd do one here too!  I'm Shay Skobeleva, 25 years old, and I work as a private tutor for the children of the lawyers, doctors, and executives of NYC.   I went to university for genetics, but became disillusioned with the field after going to medical school. I decided to leave medical school and start a private tutoring company, and I couldn't be happier! I get to work with kids of all ages, and use science experiments to teach them more interesting math and science concepts than they're getting in school.   I also teach pretty much every other subject, and do test prep. Surprisingly, there's a huge demand in the fall for prep for the Gifted and Talented Kindergarten Entry exam here in NYC. That boils down to **training 4-year olds to take an 80 question test!**   I usually work between 10-15 hours/week, and spend my spare writing books, doing art projects, and inventing things.   My latest e-book is currently free, and it's a [sarcastic textbook on personal hygiene](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06ZZNN2W8) that I wrote after having some exceptionally smelly hall-mates in college. It makes a great (and free!) gag gift for siblings.  I also wrote a more serious premed guide, which you can see [here](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00K87UJVU).  Invention wise, I recently used my experience working on mosquito research at Caltech to invent this low-cost, DIY, [Portable Mosquito Netting design](http://www.zikashield.net) to try and help stop the spread of Zika Virus.    **EDIT:** A lot of people are asking about how I feel about the disparity between the ability of my clients to afford this prep and the ability of the less wealthy. This is something that I actively aim to combat, by releasing free test prep resources on my website. This past year, I wrote a free 50-question practice test for the Gifted and Talented Exam, which is unheard of in the industry. Additionally, I wrote downloadable practice tests for around 1/3 of the cost of the competition, as well as a free book on how to effectively study with your kids at home. Those are available [here](http://www.altiora.NYC/publications). I'm actively writing more materials and producing videos to give away for free or low cost, more will come out in the next months!  So, Ask Me Anything!  **My Proof:**    Website: www.altiora.nyc   [Previous AMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/5ad7x6/ive_gotten_a_few_ama_requests_so_here_goes_im_24/)

science ama series: iâ€™m cassandra quave, a medical ethnobotanist. i study the botanical ingredients used in traditional medicines for infectious disease to discover new solutions for antibiotic resistance. ama! Hi, Reddit!   Iâ€™m Cassandra Quave, a medical ethnobotanist at Emory Universityâ€™s Center for Human Health and Department of Dermatology in the School of Medicine. Ethnobotany is the study of human interactions with plants â€” especially in traditional societies that incorporate wild plants into their daily lives. My lab is focused on studying the botanical ingredients used in traditional medicines for infectious disease to discover new solutions for one of the worldâ€™s most pressing medical issues: Antibiotic resistance. Traditional healers in the Amazon, for example, have used the Brazilian peppertree for hundreds of years to treat infections of the skin and soft tissues. We recently discovered that the red berries of this plant â€” an invasive, noxious weed common in Florida â€”contain a medicinal mechanism with the power to disarm dangerous antibiotic-resistant staph bacteria known as MRSA. This mechanism works by simply disrupting the ability of MRSA to produce toxins, so the bodyâ€™s natural immune system can work to better clear the infection.   You can read more about this discovery here: http://esciencecommons.blogspot.com/2017/02/brazilian-peppertree-packs-power-to.html   And here is a link to my web site: http://etnobotanica.us/   **I'll be back at 1pm EST to answer your questions. Ask me anything!**

was painful acne ever an issue in ww2? if i slept in the dirt for weeks between ages 17-22, i'd have breakouts constantly. is hollywood's portrayal of dirty--yet unblemished--soldiers accurate, or do we have photos, documentation to show otherwise? Watching 'Band of Brothers' and 'the Pacific' and there's not a pimple in sight, is war good for the skin? It's funny because they go to great lengths to show how sweaty/greasy/dirty they are, but everyone has great skin.

tifu something that should be on the outside is now on the inside This actually happened only a few hours ago. I was laying on the couch watching Wedding Crashers  this afternoon. Taking a well deserved break after my last final yesterday.   When I watch movies I have a habit of putting my wedding ring in my mouth and flipping it between my lips and teeth with my tongue. I rarely even realize that I'm doing it. I let out a thunderous laugh during the "notch on your belt" line.   My ring slid down into my throat and playing a dangerous game between my trachea and esophagus. And it chose my trachea. I sat up rapidly and coughed attempting to clear it from my windpipe. It only moved enough that when I reflexively swallowed. It ended up nestling its self deep in my stomach.   Immediately I realized my fuck up. Which was reiterated by the doctor at the hospital. "Don't put anything in your mouth that you don't intend on consuming." Thanks doc.   Well now I have to poop sift.    And tell my wife.    Marriage is indeed a hard pill to swallow.   TL;DR I swallowed my wedding ring and still haven't told my wife.   Edit: I posted a comment down below with a link to the X-ray.
